\subsection{Algorithms $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$}

\paragraph{}
Fig.~\ref{fig:class-diagram} shows an UML class diagram of the implementation.
The class \texttt{Formula} models CSP formulae of the type $F = c_1 \wedge c_2 \wedge ... \wedge c_n$, with $c_i \in C$.
It defines a member \texttt{java.util.ArrayList} over \texttt{Constraint}.
The classes \texttt{Constraint} and \texttt{SimpleBound} model simple constraints and simple bounds, respectively, as defined in def.~2 from~\cite{MF19}.
\texttt{Constraint}, too, defines a \texttt{java.util.ArrayList} member, except this one is over \texttt{SimpleBound}.
The methods \texttt{isTrue()}, \texttt{isFalse()} and \texttt{isInconclusive()} of these classes can be used to compute the truth values of the respective instance.
The class \texttt{Variable} models a variable, with a lower and an upper bound; \texttt{Valuation} models an interval valuation of a single variable.
Our implementation's use of valuations is described in section~\ref{ssec:valuations}.

\paragraph{}
The main part is the class \texttt{CspSolver}.
It implements the algorithm $\mathcal{A}$, and, by enabling the flag \texttt{CspSolver.enableDeductionStep}, also algorithm $\mathcal{B}$. This implementation is a plain implementation of the algorithms described in~\cite{MF19}, without any optimisations.

After assigning an instance of \texttt{Formula}, the method \texttt{CspSolver.start()} can be called.
Inside that method runs a very simple state machine, realised by an infinite loop and the states in the enumeration \texttt{State}.
Following the algorithm, the initial state is \texttt{State.CONSISTENCY\_CHECK}.
Depending on the state, the corresponding method of \texttt{CspSolver} is called, where each method returns the next state.

As one would expect, the method \texttt{CspSolver.consistencyCheck()} implements step 1, \texttt{.backtrack()} step 2 and \texttt{.decision()} step 3 of algorithms $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ (the latter after enabling the flag \texttt{CspSolver.enableDeductionStep}).

\texttt{CspSolver.backtrack()} and \texttt{.decision()} use the \texttt{backtrackAlternatives} member of the same class to store the backtrack alternatives.
It's an instance of the \texttt{java.util.Stack} class from the Java standard library.
It offers everything our implementation needed, so we didn't see any reason to create our own stack implementation.

When the algorithm reaches a result in either \texttt{CspSolver.consistencyCheck()} or \texttt{.backtrack()}, a special case of \texttt{State} is returned by these methods (not seen in figure~\ref{fig:class-diagram}).
This is converted to an instance of \texttt{Result} and returned by \texttt{CspSolver.start()}, thus exiting the infinite loop.


\subsubsection{Interval Valuations}\label{ssec:valuations}

\paragraph{}
Instead of having a single data structure to store the interval valuations of all variables (like the function $\rho$ from the task description indicates), a new instance of \texttt{Valuation} is created every time a new interval valuation is needed (simply ``valuations'' from now on).

\paragraph{}
Valuations utilise Java's reference semantic to alter the lower and upper bounds of variables they are intended for.
Just as simple bounds, valuations store only references to the actual variables.
So when a valuation changes the bounds of the variable stored inside it, the bounds of the same variable stored inside some \texttt{SimpleBound}-instance is also changed (because they're technically the same).
The next time the truth value of one of those simple bounds is computed, the new bounds are used.
\texttt{Valuation.activate()} can be used to assign new bounds to the \texttt{Variable} instance stored inside that valuation.
The object diagrams seen in fig.~\ref{fig:valuation-before} and fig.~\ref{fig:valuation-after} show what happens in memory when a valuation is activated.

Because the algorithm doesn't use valuations more than once, they are only stored in the backtrack alternatives stack, if at all.
When two new valuations are created during the decision step, the one not stored as a backtrack alternative is directly activated and then left to be collected by the JVM's garbage collector.
During the backtrack step, the alternative is popped off of the \texttt{CspSolver.backtrackAlternatives}-stack, and then similarly activated and left to be collected.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Implementation of Algorithm $\mathcal{B}$}

\paragraph{}
As described before, our implementation allows to switch to algorithm~$\mathcal{B}$ by enabling the flag \texttt{CspSolver.enableDeductionStep}.
If that flag is enabled, the consistency check changes its behaviour when there're no false constraints and not all constraints are true.
In that case, the implementation iterates over all constraints, uses \texttt{Constraint.isUnit()} to check whether its unit and, if so, calls \texttt{SimpleBound.deduceValuation()} on all simple bounds of that constraint to try to deduce new valuations for $x$ and $y$ of that simple bound as defined in algorithm~$\mathcal{B}$.

If at least one variable's valuation could be narrowed down by doing this, the method returns true.
In that case, the implementation switches to the state \texttt{State.CONSISTENCY\_CHECK}, otherwise to \texttt{State.DECISION}.


\subsubsection{Lazy Clause Evaluation \& Decision Heuristics}

\paragraph{}
Because of time constraints, neither of these optimisations could be implemented, but we wanted to give a rough idea of what we would've liked to implement.

\paragraph{Lazy Clause Evaluation}
The idea here was to implement some kind of observer pattern.
The classes \texttt{Variable} and \texttt{SimpleBound} would be become observables, and \texttt{SimpleBound} and \texttt{Constraint} would become observers.
\texttt{SimpleBound}-instances would be observers of the variables contained in them, analogous \texttt{Constraint}-instances would become observers of the simple bounds contained in them.

Whenever a variable changes, it sends a signal to its observers (i.e. the simple bounds the variable is a part of).
Upon receiving this signal, the simple bound computes its new truth value, stores it inside a class member and sends a signal to its observers (i.e. the constraints it's part of, which is usually only one).
Those \texttt{Constraint}-instances also compute and store their new truth value, but don't send any signal as they're not observables.

When calling the respective truth-value-methods of simple bounds and constraints, the stored truth value is simply returned.
This way, truth values are only computed when it's possible for them to change.
Compared to the current implementation, this would save a lot of loop iterations, as currently the truth value is re-computed every time when it's asked for.
But we didn't calculate how many iterations exactly would've been saved.


\paragraph{Decision Heuristics}
We would've liked to implement a very random decision step, where variable choice, interval splitting and interval deciding were done completely random.
Using command-line-interface flags, one were supposed to be able to select any combination of these three to be random.
This way a small benchmark could've been done to see which of the three had the biggest impact on performance.
For this to be feasible and to actually benefit from this, we would've needed a lot of example CSPs.
