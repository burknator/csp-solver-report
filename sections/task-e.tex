\subsection{Decision Heuristics}

\begin{enumerate}[(e)]
    \item \textbf{Optional:} Think about possible decision heuristics: Which heuristics –in your opinion– for a variable choice, for interval splitting and interval deciding make sense in this framework and why?
\end{enumerate}

Only the intervals of variables which are contained in constraints that are inconclusive at the time of interval splitting should be split. Should a variable v1 be contained only in constrain c1, which is true at the time of the split, while constraint c2 is the one being inconclusive, splitting the interval of v1 has no impact on the truth value of the inconclusive constraint c2. The algorithm should therefore choose a different variable, one that is actually contained in c2.
