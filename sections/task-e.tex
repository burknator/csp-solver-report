\subsection{Decision Heuristics}

\begin{enumerate}[(e)]
    \item \textbf{Optional:} Think about possible decision heuristics: Which heuristics –in your opinion– for a variable choice, for interval splitting and interval deciding make sense in this framework and why?
\end{enumerate}

Only the intervals of variables which are contained in constraints that are inconclusive at the time of interval splitting should be split. Should a variable $v_1$ be contained only in simple bound $s_1$, which is true at the time of the split, while simple bound $s_2$ is the one being inconclusive, splitting the interval of $v_1$ has no impact on the truth value of the inconclusive simple bound $s_2$. The algorithm should therefore choose a different variable, one that is actually contained in $s_2$.
