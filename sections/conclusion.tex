\section{Conclusion}

The backtrack algorithm was to be implemented, including a parser to read the input CSP. We did not have enough time to enhance the algorithm by impplementing lazy clause evaluation or decision heuristics, though. 

The backtrack algorithm is sound and complete and the constraint solving with the given type of constraints is NP-complete, since simple CSP problems can be created from boolean SAT problems. When using real numbers instead of integers for the domains of the variables, the backtrack algorithm does not always terminate in finite time.
