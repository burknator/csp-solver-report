\subsection{CSPs with reals}

\begin{enumerate}[(d)]
    \item Assume that we generalize the definition of a simple CSP s.t. the domains of the variables are (possibly) infinite, but still bounded, e.g. intervals over the reals, and simple bounds are of the form $x \sim y + r$ with $\sim \in {\geq , >}$ and $r \in R$. Let $\mathcal{P}$ be such a generalized simple CSP.
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
        \item Does algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ work correctly on $\mathcal{P}$, i.e. is the result correct? If this is not the case, can $\mathcal{A}$ be adapted? Give reasons for your answer.
        \item Does algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ terminate on $\mathcal{P}$? If this is not the case, can $\mathcal{A}$ be adapted? Give reasons for your answer.
    \end{enumerate}
    Remark: we consider the algorithm here in theory and not its behavior on a resource limited machine.
\end{enumerate}
